NanoHTTPd - the tiniest, most secure webserver ever written
================================================================================
Write cool stuff here
----------------
HOW TO BUILD:
	Just run "make". You will need NASM on your system.
----------------
You may find this source code confusing, which is a direct result of the fact
that it's REALLY FUCKING CONFUSING. My attempts to justify this confusion are
as follows:
	Q: Why is this thing the "most secure ever"? Do I even know you?
	A: The classic unintentional vulnerability that plagues x86 code is the
	   stack-smash: you leverage a buffer overflow of a stack variable to
	   overwrite return addresses on the stack, thereby gaining control of
	   the execution of the program. Nanohttpd has no stack, because
	   Nanohttpd has no functions, and thus such an attack becomes
	   impossible. It chroots itself into its webroot, drops privilages, and
	   never opens any file descriptor for writing. That doesn't mean there
	   aren't any bugs (heh heh), but where there are bugs they should be
	   rather docile.
	Q: Why the fuck do you #include all the source files into one file?
	A: The linker doesn't handle code written like this very well. Twice, I
	   spent a significant amount of time chasing bugs that turned out to
	   be due to the linker incorrectly optimizing out chunks of code.
	   It was also extremely annoying to have to declare tons and tons of
	   variables "extern", and this avoids that.
	Q: What's up with that insane syscall macro?
	A: You can find an explanation of how to use it in the /src folder.
	   Once you get the hang of it, it makes understanding the program a
	   whole lot easier.
	Q: Why do you use NASM? Everybody hates Intel syntax
	A: I learned the Intel syntax, so it's much more natural for me to code
	   in that dialect. If you want AT&T syntax, run `objdump -d` on the
	   compiled binary.
