AsmHTTPd - the tiniest, most secure webserver ever written
================================================================================
HOW TO BUILD:
	Just run "make". You will need NASM on your system.
----------------
HOW TO RUN:
	./asmhttpd

Frequently asked questions:
	Q: Why is this thing the "most secure ever"? Do I even know you?
	A: The classic unintentional vulnerability that plagues x86 code is the
	   stack-smash: you leverage a buffer overflow of a stack variable to
	   overwrite return addresses on the stack, thereby gaining control of
	   the execution of the program. Asmhttpd has no stack, because
	   Asmhttpd has no functions, and thus such an attack becomes
	   impossible.
	Q: But isn't syscall() a function?
	A: No, it's a macro. See doc/syscall-macro.txt for information on its
	   usage. It's pretty much the epitome of preprocessor clusterfuck.
	Q: Why are all the source files #included into a single file?
	A: The linker doesn't handle code written like this very well. Twice, I
	   spent a significant amount of time chasing bugs that turned out to
	   be due to the linker incorrectly optimizing out chunks of code.
	Q: Why do you use NASM?
	A: If I did this now, I would probably just have it compile with GCC,
	   but I didn't know any better back when I wrote it.
	Q: Can this run on 32-bit x86en?
	A: No. It may be portable to x86-32, but I really have no idea how that
	   works. Feel free to try.
	Q: Do you plan on porting this to other CPU architectures?
	A: "Porting" is really a misnomer here, since about 90% of the code
	   would have to be rewritten. I've been meaning to learn ARM assembly
	   for a long time now, and that might be a good way to do it. But I
	   don't see that happening anytime in the near future...

REPORTING BUGS:
	Bug reports are greatly appreciated! The most useful information is the
	line that probably got printed in `dmesg`, which shows the address of
	the instruction which caused the segfault. Core dumps are not of much
	use, but send them if you have them. If the bug doesn't crash the
	daemon, send me a very detailed description of what you did to cause
	the issue.
