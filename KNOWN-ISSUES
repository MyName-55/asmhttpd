HTTP error responses don't seem to work - Chrome and Firefox both show blank
screens instead of their own error messages.
=============================
When escaping %xx literals, there is no validation of the 'xx', so the client
can insert arbitrary bytes into the URL. This doesn't matter (in fact it could
be viewed as a nice feature), but it does allow the client to insert a NULL
byte in the URL. Since we deal with lengths when processing the URL, I don't
see how that could be a problem, but it's something to be aware of. Certainly,
in processing a blacklist of files, it could be a problem, but we don't do
that and probably never will.
